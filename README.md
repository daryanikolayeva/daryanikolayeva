🚀 Academic Projects


🔹 Online Sales Database + Java CLI (SQL + Java) (Team Project)

Designed and implemented a relational database system from dataset selection and ER modeling to normalization and SQL queries, with a Java CLI interface and testing on a university Linux server.


🔹 Airport Runway Simulation (C++)

Event-driven simulation using priority queues to manage takeoff/landing schedules and runway availability.


🔹 Garbage Collector (C)

Simulated manual memory management using a custom mark-and-sweep garbage collector to explore low-level system control.


🔹 Mountaineering Gear Expert System (Prolog)

Knowledge-based expert system for recommending mountaineering gear using certainty factors (CFs), CF combination logic, a custom search routine, and warning messages for safety and missing requirements.


🔹 Graph Analysis Tool (Java)

Solved the challenge of analyzing weighted graphs: built MST using Prim’s and found Hamiltonian cycles with backtracking.


🔹 Game of Trees (Java)

Two-player word game using BST and 2-3 Tree structures for attacking and defending based on word frequency.


🔹 Meal Tracker (Java)

Logs meals and calculates nutritional values (calories, protein, fat). Generates dietary reports based on input files.


🔹 Greed Game (Java)

Console game where players move on a 20x80 grid to collect digits. Implements logic-limited movement and score tracking.


🔹 Tic Tac Toe (Java)

Custom-size grid, random turn order, and full win-checking logic. Great demonstration of conditionals and OOP.
