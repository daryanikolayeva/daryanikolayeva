## ðŸš€ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Graph Analysis Tool (Java)
Solved the challenge of analyzing weighted graphs: built MST using Primâ€™s and found Hamiltonian cycles with backtracking.

### ðŸ”¹ Garbage Collector (C)
Simulated manual memory management using a custom mark-and-sweep garbage collector to explore low-level system control.

### ðŸ”¹ Statistical Toolkit (C++) *(In Progress)*
CLI app to automate statistical analysis from CSV input: computes mean, variance, regression, and more.

### ðŸ”¹ Game of Trees (Java)
Two-player word game using BST and 2-3 Tree structures for attacking and defending based on word frequency.

### ðŸ”¹ Meal Tracker (Java)
Logs meals and calculates nutritional values (calories, protein, fat). Generates dietary reports based on input files.

### ðŸ”¹ Airport Runway Simulation (C++)
Event-driven simulation using priority queues to manage takeoff/landing schedules and runway availability.

### ðŸ”¹ Greed Game (Java)
Console game where players move on a 20x80 grid to collect digits. Implements logic-limited movement and score tracking.

### ðŸ”¹ Tic Tac Toe (Java)
Custom-size grid, random turn order, and full win-checking logic. Great demonstration of conditionals and OOP.
